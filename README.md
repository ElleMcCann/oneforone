oneforone
=========
Oneforone is a game to support diversity! 

How it works
---
Name the person who is as qualified as you, but has a characteristic that's under-represented in your field. For example, if you're a man, you can name a woman. If you're white, you can name a person of color, if you're straight, name someone who is LGBTQ, if you're able-bodied, name someone who has a disability, etc. 

Contributing
---
You can add yourself and your oneforone in [names](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/blob/master/names.yml), maintained in an easy-to-read YAML file (".yml"). Content and feature suggestions are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/issues/new). Code contributions are welcome via [pull request](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/compare).

Know someone who you admire, and want to know their oneforone? [Tag them in an issue](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/issues/new) and we'll ask if they'll contribute!

Have an idea for a project that could use this data, like a ["who to follow" recommendation tool](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/issues/8) based on the people you currently follow, or [a browser plug-in that highlights names in articles/listicles/speaker line-ups that have listed their oneforone](https://github.com/techladymafia/oneforone/issues/9)?

More about the project
---
Here's [more about the nexus of the game](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2012/07/09/a-challenge-to-digital-influencers-join-the-one4one-game/), created by [Deanna Zandt](https://twitter.com/Deanna), [Melissa Pierce](https://twitter.com/melissapierce) and [Andrew Rasej](https://twitter.com/Rasiej).

This repo was created as an experiment during [transparency camp](http://transparencycamp.org/), and for [Ada Lovelace day](http://findingada.com/) -- October 14th -- we're asking folks to add their oneforone.
