oneforone
=========

This is a repo where you can play oneforone! Here's [more about the nexus of the game](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2012/07/09/a-challenge-to-digital-influencers-join-the-one4one-game/).


How it works
---
Oneforone is a game to support diversity! 

Name the person who is exactly as qualified as you, but has a different characteristic that's under-represented in your field. For example, if you're a man, you can name a woman. If you're white, you can name a person of color, if you're straight, name someone who is LGBTQ, if you're able-bodied, name someone who has a disability, etc. 

The oneforone data is maintained in an easy-to-read YAML file (".yml") in /names.
